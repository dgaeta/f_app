Hi,

I'm Kevin, one of the co-founders of Fitsby. I saw that you recently started a new Fitsby game and I wanted to let you know that I am always here if you have any questions or feedback. I want to make sure your experience is as seamless as possible :)


Let me know what I can do for you!
- Kevin

P.S. The only time we will ever code anything is when we get your feedback! If you want to request something, don't hesitate to let us know.
