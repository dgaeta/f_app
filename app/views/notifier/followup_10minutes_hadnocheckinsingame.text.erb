Hi,

Kevin here, again. I noticed that you checked in 0 times during your Fitsby game. Looks like our app isn't doing what it was supposed to do, which is help you reach your workout goal. There's a reason you signed up for Fitsby, and I wanted to personally reach out to you and ask you for your advice on what we can change. We're always working on making Fitsby better and would truly appreciate your input.


Have an awesome day!
- Kevin

P.S. We'd really love to have you back onboard Fitsby -- just let us know what to do, and we'll start coding right away!
