FOR FITSBY EMPLOYEES ONLY

This user just worked out at an unverified gym and requested that we verify it:


Description: <%= @string %>
Decided Location ID: <%= @decidedlocations_id %>
User id :<%= @user.id %>
User email :<%= @user_email %>
Gym name :<%= @gym_name %>
Number of Requests for this Gym :<%= @number_of_requests_for_gym %> 
Number of requests this user has made for this gym<%= @number_of_requests_by_user %>


Go into PGAdmin and change the column called "decision" in the table called "decidedlocations" (where 1 means "blacklisted" and is not a real gym, and 0 means "whitelisted" and means that the gym is good to go.
